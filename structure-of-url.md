Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a term familiar to most people, as it is used to locate resources on the internet. When you type a URL into a web browser's address bar, you are accessing a "resource", not just a webpage. 
 
URLs comprise several components: 
 
ðŸ”¹The protocol or scheme, such as http, https, and ftp. 
ðŸ”¹The domain name and port, separated by a period (.) 
ðŸ”¹The path to the resource, separated by a slash (/) 
ðŸ”¹The parameters, which start with a question mark (?) and consist of key-value pairs, such as a=b&c=d. 
ðŸ”¹The fragment or anchor, indicated by a pound sign (#), which is used to bookmark a specific section of the resource.
