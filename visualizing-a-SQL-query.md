SQL statements are executed by the database system in several steps, including:
- Parsing the SQL statement and checking its validity
- Transforming the SQL into an internal representation, such as relational algebra
- Optimizing the internal representation and creating an execution plan that utilizes index information
- Executing the plan and returning the results
